# About

## The SOMA

The SOMA is part of the [EHS Data Standards](https://github.com/EHS-Data-Standards)
initiative, focused on developing standardized data models for environmental health sciences research.

## Project Goals

This project aims to:

1. **Standardize data representation** for exposure-outcome relationships in EHS research
2. **Enable data interoperability** across studies, cohorts, and institutions
3. **Support mechanistic understanding** through integration with Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs)
4. **Bridge epidemiological and toxicological data** from human studies and model systems

## The Data Model

### Design Principles

The SOMA follows these principles:

- **Ontology-first** - All entities are mapped to established biomedical ontologies
- **FAIR-compliant** - Supports Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable data
- **Extensible** - New assay types can be added without breaking existing data
- **Multi-scale** - Captures data from molecular to population levels

### Technology Stack

The model is built using:

- [LinkML](https://linkml.io/) - Linked Data Modeling Language for schema definition
- [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
  for documentation
- Python for data validation and transformation

### Core Domains

| Domain | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Assays | Domain-specific assay classes with named measurement slots (e.g., CiliaryFunctionAssay, LungFunctionAssay) |
| Study Subjects | Biological systems under study: cell cultures (CellularSystem), human/animal subjects (InVivoSubject), populations (PopulationSubject) |
| Protocols | Typed experimental procedures: ImagingProtocol, MolecularAssayProtocol, StainingProtocol, SpirometryProtocol |
| AOP Framework | Adverse Outcome Pathways: KeyEvent, AdverseOutcomePathway, with assay linkage via `informs_on_key_event` |
